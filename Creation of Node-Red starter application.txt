Creation of Node-Red starter application

1. Once we sign in to our IBM Cloud account, we can navigate to the catalog and find the NODE-RED Starter application.
2. This gives us a Node-RED instance running as a Cloud Foundry application. It also provides a Cloudant database instance and a collection of nodes that make it easy to access various IBM Cloud services.
3. On clicking the starter application we want to use, we give it a name and click create.
