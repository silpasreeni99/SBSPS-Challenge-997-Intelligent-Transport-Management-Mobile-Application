Introduction to Watson Studio and Watson Assistant

1. WATSON STUDIO:
It provides us with the environment and tools to solve our business problems by collaboratively working with data. We can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, to cleanse and shape data, to ingest streaming data, or to create and train machine learning models.
